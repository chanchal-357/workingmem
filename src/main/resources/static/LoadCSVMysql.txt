I had the same problem, albeit on Windows 8.1 64 bit. In my case, the cause was a power usage problem, whereby a lot of power usage caused Windows to shut down certain functions and peripherals to save power.

Go to Control Panel and select Power Options. Then click on Edit Plan Settings. Click on "Change Advanced Power Settings" and when the Power Option box appears, expand USB Settings and PCI Express. Make sure USB setting is "Disabled" and PCI express is "Off".
